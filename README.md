# Data Analysis of Purchase Patterns

## Project Overview
This project explores the influence of demographic and categorical variables on purchase behavior, focusing on factors such as gender, age, country, and product category. Various statistical methods, including ANOVA, linear regression, and t-tests, were employed to analyze the data and identify significant trends.

## Key Findings
- **ANOVA Analysis**: No significant differences in purchase amounts were found across gender, country, or product categories.
- **Linear Regression**: The model showed a low R-squared value, indicating that the analyzed variables do not strongly predict purchase amounts.
- **T-Tests**: No significant difference was observed in purchase amounts between male and female buyers.
- **Data Normality**: Non-normal distribution was identified, suggesting that future analyses may benefit from transformations or alternative methods.

## Tools and Packages Used
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, scikit-learn
- **Statistical Methods**: ANOVA, linear regression, t-tests, normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that gender, age, country, and product category have minimal influence on purchase behavior. More complex factors or additional data may be needed for deeper insights.
